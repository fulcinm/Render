##### Software Development Tools Project

In this project data from a market of used cars was used to determine different factors that influenced the price of each car listing. The price of each car model can be compared by year using the drop down, as well as the specific year(s) of each model using the slider icon. The next drop down determines how distribution of price varies depending on transmission, cylinders, type, and condition. Each variable can be chosen from the drop down to compare the price of each cars specifications. Lastly a drop down for odometer and number of days the car was listed was used to determine how distribution of price varies between those two constraints. A scatterplot shows the variations in price compared to the number of days the car(s) were listed as well as the odometer reading(s).
